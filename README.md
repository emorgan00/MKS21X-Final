__Development Log:__

_Day 1 (2019-01-03):_
Added basic classes: Vector, Triangle, Particle, Camera
Most of the methods here are simple math. The only complex components done today were the Vector.intersectsTriangle() method and the methods for the Camera buffers.

_Day 2 (2019-01-04):_
Added rendering to the Camera. Added support for lanterna Screens in Camera.
Added Shape class.

_Day 3 (2019-01-05):_
Added 3D rotation algorithm for Vectors.
Added lighting when rendering faces.
The expected product is now complete. Running Driver.java will show a rotating cube.

_Day 4 (2019-01-06):_
Added the Rubik's Cube demo.
